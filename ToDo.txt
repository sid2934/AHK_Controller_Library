Things to implement/look into

To allow the user to select how ever many button combos they wish to, enable a Custom priority queue from some kind of config file.
This custom priority queue will look at all button combinations the users wishes to use for each button starting with 1 and going to the last on. for example say they want the following buttons/combinations to exist; 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 3 + 4, 1 + 4, 2, 3, 3 + 4, 4, 5
This queue should look for all buttons which have only one way to get triggered (i.e. they are by themself (5) in this case)
Then once all are even if starts to analyze the best route to esove the buttons quickly the result should be.
This is the first approach to this issue and is likly not the best solution.
