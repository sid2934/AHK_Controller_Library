Things to get done/look into in order from next to last

Completed
Get the ButtonHandler function in ControllerCore.ahk functioning
	Needs to go through the Button Event Queue and see if all of the buttons for a event are pressed and if so
	remove those buttons from the string and call the correct function, then continue with the rest of the buttons

1) Make/Fine a good Stack class to implement a double/triple click functionality. This my involve preventing the buttonHandler
	function from running if nothing is pressed. The cycle may be (and more than likely is) to fast to only look at the top 
	of the 	stack plus holding down a button may also trigger the multi clicks. Possible implements a way to see if a button
	has been released to prevent false triggers. This will more than likely take alot of work.


3) Optomize the buttonHandler() function

4) Add documentation to the code added since last time

5) More
